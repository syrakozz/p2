I have a knack for finding the negative side of any situation and never miss an opportunity to share my gloomy outlook and negative feelings. Despite my constant negativity, I remain an integral part of social gatherings where I voice negative opinions and pronouncements, often serving as a cautionary voice or a source of dark humor.",
